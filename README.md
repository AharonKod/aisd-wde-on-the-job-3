# Web Dev Essentials On the Job

## Project Description ðŸ“„

In this ongoing assignment, you'll experience what it's like to work as a web developer, building a website from the ground up using HTML and CSS. This project will guide you through the process of creating and styling a professional website, reinforcing your understanding of the foundational concepts of web development.

Throughout this assignment, you'll be tasked with building different sections of a website, each designed to introduce new HTML and CSS concepts. Youâ€™ll start with the basic structure using HTML, and as you progress, youâ€™ll enhance the siteâ€™s design and functionality with various CSS techniques and frameworks.

## Scenario ðŸŒŸ

You have taken on a client who is a small but growing business. Your task is to build them a new website to showcase their products/services and build an online presence.

### Choose Your Client:
- Band
- Pet Store
- Bakery
- Gym
- Or your own idea!

## Key Stages of the Project ðŸš€

1. **Basic HTML Structure**: Set up the core structure of your website.
2. **CSS Styling**: Enhance your site using various CSS techniques.
3. **Advanced Design**: Utilize CSS frameworks to create a polished, responsive design.

Review the included example which represents the kind of site you'll have created by the time you finish all 4 on the job projects. Adjust to your preference.

## Resources ðŸ“¦

Free stock images and videos can be downloaded at https://www.pexels.com.

Utilize documentation such as [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for all things related to HTML and CSS.

Use AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude to help you learn. As you integrate AI tools into your learning process, it's essential to use them responsibly. AI can be a powerful resource to assist you, but itâ€™s important to ensure that you truly understand and engage with the content it generates. This will not only enhance your learning experience but also help you develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Checkpoint 3 âœ‹

### Creating a Grid ðŸ“„

Now that we have our site's HTML and CSS is a good state, let's look at how we can incorporate CSS Grid into our site. The main candidate here will be the gallery of images we created in the first checkpoint but you have some flexibility as this is your site. By the end of this stage, your image gallery will be neatly structured, flexible, and visually appealing across devices.

#### Deliverables âœ…

- [ ] We will now continue building on the repository created in checkpoint 1. (Do not create a new repository.)
- [ ] Apply CSS grid to your gallery of images to create neat rows and columns
- [ ] Ensure that your grid is responsive. As the window (screen) gets smaller the grid should adapt. This can be done with media queries or the built-in responsive grid.
- [ ] Use Git to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to the repository for your project.
